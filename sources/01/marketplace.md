# Marketplace Discoveries

## Context

Discovered on small clay tablets among the ruins of what appears to be merchant stalls in the old marketplace. The tablets were remarkably well preserved, suggesting they were fired clay rather than simple dried mud. Several tablets were found together, indicating they may have been part of a merchant's records or public announcements.
