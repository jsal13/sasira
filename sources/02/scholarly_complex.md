# Scholarly Complex Discoveries

## Context

Found in the ruins of what appears to be a scholar's study and adjacent underground chambers beneath the main temple complex. These texts were written on papyrus and stored in sealed ceramic jars, along with several other documents and scrolls. The underground chamber was only discovered when part of the temple floor collapsed during excavation, revealing a hidden archive of scholarly works.
