# Sasiran Language Game - Context Instructions for AI Assistants

## Project Overview
This directory contains materials for a language translation game featuring **Sasiran** - a constructed ancient language discovered in fictional archaeological ruins. Players must translate discovered texts using contextual clues and a growing understanding of the language.

## Language Characteristics
- **Constructed language** inspired by **Akkadian and Egyptian**
- Uses **Ethiopian (Ge'ez) and Georgian characters** to represent letters
- **Phonology emphasizes sibilants** (s, z, š, ž, ṣ, ḫ) with minimal plosives
- **SOV word order** (Subject-Object-Verb)
- Simple grammar with clear morphological patterns

## How to Use This Context

### For Translation Tasks
1. **Reference the dictionary** (`reference/dictionary.md`) for vocabulary
2. **Check example sentences** (`reference/example_sentences.md`) for grammar patterns
3. **Consider archaeological context** from the relevant source file
4. **Apply Sasiran grammar rules**:
   - SOV word order
   - Past tense: add **-უმ**
   - Future tense: add **-ალ** 
   - Plurals: add **-იმ**
   - Possessive: add **-შ**

### For Content Creation
When adding new texts to source files:
- **Use markdown format** with `## Context` and `## Texts` sections
- **Provide archaeological context** explaining where/how text was discovered
- **Use appropriate difficulty level** for the folder (01=beginner, 02=intermediate, 03=advanced)
- **Follow established vocabulary** and grammar patterns
- **Use Ethiopian/Georgian characters** authentically

### For Language Development
- **Maintain consistency** with established phonology (emphasize sibilants)
- **Build on existing vocabulary** before creating new words
- **Follow SOV grammar patterns** established in examples
- **Keep morphology simple** and regular

## Key Grammar Reminders
- **Word Order:** Subject-Object-Verb (SOV)
- **Tenses:** 
  - Present: base verb form
  - Past: verb + უმ
  - Future: verb + ალ
- **Plurals:** noun + იმ
- **Possession:** noun + შ
- **Common patterns:** Use example sentences as templates

## Character Usage Notes
- Mix **Georgian script** (მ, ნ, რ, ს, ზ, etc.) and **Ethiopian/Ge'ez** (ሳ, ኃ, etc.)
- **Sibilants should dominate** phonetically
- **Avoid heavy plosive clusters** (minimal b, p, t, k sounds)

## Archaeological Context Themes
- **01/ (Beginner):** Daily life, marketplace, basic temple areas
- **02/ (Intermediate):** Ceremonial practices, scholarly activities
- **03/ (Advanced):** Sacred mysteries, complex architectural inscriptions, prophecies

## Translation Game Mechanics
Players encounter texts with:
1. **Archaeological context** (where/how found)
2. **Sasiran text** to translate
3. **Contextual clues** to aid translation
4. **Progressive difficulty** requiring accumulated knowledge

## Quick Start Command for AI Assistants
When working with Sasiran, read these key files first:
1. `reference/dictionary.md` - Core vocabulary and grammar
2. `reference/example_sentences.md` - Sentence patterns
3. Relevant source file from `sources/` directory for context

This will provide complete context for translation work, content creation, or language development tasks.
