# Tower Complex Discoveries - Solutions

## Context
Found carved into the capstone of the highest tower in the complex. The inscription circles the entire stone and can only be read by walking around the circumference. Weather damage has made some sections nearly illegible, but the surviving portions suggest this was a monument or dedication of great importance to the ancient inhabitants.
